Contributing to python-phonenumbers
===================================

Contributions are welcome, but please be aware that the project is directly
derived from the upstream
[upstream Java project](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber).

As a result, any changes to the phonenumber metadata or to the API should be
[submitted there](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues) rather
than here; only issues or contributions that are specific to the Python version
are likely to be relevant here.
