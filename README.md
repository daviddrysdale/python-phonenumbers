phonenumbers Python Library
===========================

This is a Python port of [Google's libphonenumber library](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber)
It supports Python 2.5-2.7 and Python 3.x (in the same codebase, with no
[2to3](http://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html) conversion needed).

Original Java code is Copyright (C) 2009-2013 The Libphonenumber Authors

Example Usage
-------------

The main object that the library deals with is a `PhoneNumber` object.  You can create this from a string
representing a phone number using the `parse` function, but you also need to specify the country
that the phone number is being dialled from (unless the number is in E.164 format, which is globally
unique).

```pycon
>>> import phonenumbers
>>> x = phonenumbers.parse("+442083661177", None)
>>> print x
Country Code: 44 National Number: 2083661177 Leading Zero: False
>>> type(x)
<class 'phonenumbers.phonenumber.PhoneNumber'>
>>> y = phonenumbers.parse("020 8366 1177", "GB")
>>> print y
Country Code: 44 National Number: 2083661177 Leading Zero: False
>>> x == y
True
>>> z = phonenumbers.parse("00 1 650 253 2222", "GB")  # as dialled from GB, not a GB number
>>> print z
Country Code: 1 National Number: 6502532222 Leading Zero(s): False
```

The `PhoneNumber` object that `parse` produces typically still needs to be validated, to check whether
it's a *possible* number (e.g. it has the right number of digits) or a *valid* number (e.g. it's
in an assigned exchange).

```pycon
>>> z = phonenumbers.parse("+120012301", None)
>>> print z
Country Code: 1 National Number: 20012301 Leading Zero: False
>>> phonenumbers.is_possible_number(z)  # too few digits for USA
False
>>> phonenumbers.is_valid_number(z)
False
>>> z = phonenumbers.parse("+12001230101", None)
>>> print z
Country Code: 1 National Number: 2001230101 Leading Zero: False
>>> phonenumbers.is_possible_number(z)
True
>>> phonenumbers.is_valid_number(z)  # NPA 200 not used
False
```

The `parse` function will also fail completely (with a `NumberParseException`) on inputs that cannot
be uniquely parsed, or that  can't possibly be phone numbers.

```pycon
>>> z = phonenumbers.parse("02081234567", None)  # no region, no + => unparseable
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "phonenumbers/phonenumberutil.py", line 2350, in parse
    "Missing or invalid default region.")
phonenumbers.phonenumberutil.NumberParseException: (0) Missing or invalid default region.
>>> z = phonenumbers.parse("gibberish", None)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "phonenumbers/phonenumberutil.py", line 2344, in parse
    "The string supplied did not seem to be a phone number.")
phonenumbers.phonenumberutil.NumberParseException: (1) The string supplied did not seem to be a phone number.
```

Once you've got a phone number, a common task is to format it in a standardized format.  There are a few
formats available (under `PhoneNumberFormat`), and the `format_number` function does the formatting.

```pycon
>>> phonenumbers.format_number(x, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.NATIONAL)
u'020 8366 1177'
>>> phonenumbers.format_number(x, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.INTERNATIONAL)
u'+44 20 8366 1177'
>>> phonenumbers.format_number(x, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.E164)
u'+442083661177'
```

If your application has a UI that allows the user to type in a phone number, it's nice to get the formatting
applied as the user types.   The `AsYouTypeFormatter` object allows this.

```pycon
>>> formatter = phonenumbers.AsYouTypeFormatter("US")
>>> print formatter.input_digit("6")
6
>>> print formatter.input_digit("5")
65
>>> print formatter.input_digit("0")
(650
>>> print formatter.input_digit("2")
(650) 2
>>> print formatter.input_digit("5")
(650) 25
>>> print formatter.input_digit("3")
(650) 253
>>> print formatter.input_digit("2")
650-2532
>>> print formatter.input_digit("2")
(650) 253-22
>>> print formatter.input_digit("2")
(650) 253-222
>>> print formatter.input_digit("2")
(650) 253-2222
```

Sometimes, you've got a larger block of text that may or may not have some phone numbers inside it.  For this,
the `PhoneNumberMatcher` object provides the relevant functionality; you can iterate over it to retrieve a
sequence of `PhoneNumberMatch` objects.  Each of these match objects holds a `PhoneNumber` object together
with information about where the match occurred in the original string.

```pycon
>>> text = "Call me at 510-748-8230 if it's before 9:30, or on 703-4800500 after 10am."
>>> for match in phonenumbers.PhoneNumberMatcher(text, "US"):
...     print match
...
PhoneNumberMatch [11,23) 510-748-8230
PhoneNumberMatch [51,62) 703-4800500
>>> for match in phonenumbers.PhoneNumberMatcher(text, "US"):
...     print phonenumbers.format_number(match.number, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.E164)
...
+15107488230
+17034800500
```

You might want to get some information about the location that corresponds to a phone number.  The
`geocoder.area_description_for_number` does this, when possible.

```pycon
>>> from phonenumbers import geocoder
>>> ch_number = phonenumbers.parse("0431234567", "CH")
>>> print repr(geocoder.description_for_number(ch_number, "de"))
u'Z\\xfcrich'
>>> print repr(geocoder.description_for_number(ch_number, "en"))
u'Zurich'
>>> print repr(geocoder.description_for_number(ch_number, "fr"))
u'Zurich'
>>> print repr(geocoder.description_for_number(ch_number, "it"))
u'Zurigo'
```

For mobile numbers in some countries, you can also find out information about which carrier
originally owned a phone number.

```pycon
>>> from phonenumbers import carrier
>>> ro_number = phonenumbers.parse("+40721234567", "RO")
>>> print repr(carrier.name_for_number(ro_number, "en"))
u'Vodafone'
```

You might also be able to retrieve a list of time zone names that the number potentially
belongs to.

```pycon
>>> from phonenumbers import timezone
>>> gb_number = phonenumbers.parse("+447986123456", "GB")
>>> str(timezone.time_zones_for_number(gb_number))
"(u'Atlantic/Reykjavik', u'Europe/London')"
```

Memory Usage
------------

The library includes a lot of metadata, giving a significant memory overhead.  This metadata is loaded on-demand so that
the memory footprint of applications that only use a subset of the library functionality is not adversely affected.

In particular:

* The geocoding metadata (which is over 100 megabytes) is only loaded on the first use of
  one of the geocoding functions (`geocoder.description_for_number`, `geocoder.description_for_valid_number`
  or `geocoder.country_name_for_number`).
* The carrier metadata is only loaded on the first use of one of the mapping functions (`carrier.name_for_number`
  or `carrier.name_for_valid_number`).
* The timezone metadata is only loaded on the first use of one of the timezone functions (`time_zones_for_number`
  or `time_zones_for_geographical_number`).
* The normal metadata for each region is only loaded on the first time that metadata for that region is needed.

If you need to ensure that the metadata memory use is accounted for at start of day (i.e. that a subsequent on-demand
load of metadata will not cause a pause or memory exhaustion):

* Force-load the geocoding metadata by invoking `import phonenumbers.geocoder`.
* Force-load the carrier metadata by invoking `import phonenumbers.carrier`.
* Force-load the timezone metadata by invoking `import phonenumbers.timezone`.
* Force-load the normal metadata by calling `phonenumbers.PhoneMetadata.load_all()`.

The `phonenumberslite` version of the package does not include the geocoding, carrier and timezone metadata,
which can be useful if you have problems installing the main `phonenumbers` package due to space/memory limitations.

Project Layout
--------------
* The `python/` directory holds the Python code.
* The `resources/` directory is a copy of the `resources/`
  directory from
  [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/tree/master/resources).
  This is not needed to run the Python code, but is needed when upstream
  changes to the master metadata need to be incorporated.
* The `tools/` directory holds the tools that are used to process upstream
  changes to the master metadata.
