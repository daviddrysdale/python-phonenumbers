====================
 What's new in 7.4.0
====================

Merge to upstream commit 598b9a4f89d6; no code changes that affect the Python
version so this is just a version bump to stay in sync with upstream.


====================
 What's new in 7.3.0
====================

Merge to upstream commit d933631fbf15; code changes:
   - Added support for region_code of None in example_number_for_type()
   - Added invalid_example_number()
   - Improvements to docstring for parse method
   - Update is_number_geographical to return true for geographical mobile numbers.


====================
 What's new in 7.2.0
====================

Merge to upstream commit ab5e61acc087ec9f5, which is 7.2.1 (7.2.0 had an immediate
problem on release); upstream changelog mentions no code changes, but the Java
implementation includes a change to use nano protobufs.


====================
 What's new in 7.1.0
====================

Merge to upstream commit 903ac5de5b6e1112; upstream code changelog:
   - Only upstream code change doesn't affect python version
     (New MetadataSource implementation that reads from a single metadata file with
     all regions' phone number metadata.)


====================
 What's new in 7.0.0
====================

Merge to upstream Subversion revision 715; upstream code changelog:
   - New APIs for ShortNumberInfo. The old APIs have been deprecated and will be
     removed in an upcoming release.


====================
 What's new in 6.3.0
====================

Merge to upstream Subversion revision 703; upstream code changelog:
   - Changing the offline geocoder to not return any country at all if the number
     could belong to multiple countries
   - Removing obsolete code that treated countries with no metadata as valid.


====================
 What's new in 6.2.0
====================

Merge to upstream Subversion revision 674; upstream code changelog:
   - Better exclusion of dates when matching phone numbers from text.
   - Handle phone input in RFC3966 with missing tel: prefix


====================
 What's new in 6.1.0
====================

Merge to upstream Subversion revision 656; upstream code changelog:
   - Adding MetadataLoader support to allow custom metadata loading from
     alternative sources (should have no visible impact to users).
   - Fixing bug where digits could be lost in as-you-type formatting and
     formatting patterns incorrectly applied.


=====================
 What's new in 6.0.0a
=====================

Split geographic metadata into chunks.
Generate separate phonenumbers-lite package.
(No upstream changes.)


====================
 What's new in 6.0.0
====================

Removed beta status.
Merge up to upstream Subversion revision 650; upstream code changelog:
   - Better support for detecting phone numbers in text that are beside each
     other
   - Change to how Japanese numbers beginning with "00" are modelled, with the
     side-effect that the maximum possible number length has been extended by
     1.
   - Handle StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in the AsYouTypeFormatter when the
     national prefix that was extracted was not found in the prefix. This
     affected countries with very long carrier codes, such as Korea.
   - Removal of some of the author attributions - contributions to be tracked
     in CONTRIBUTORS file.


=====================
 What's new in 5.9b1
=====================

The codebase now supports Python 2.5-2.7 and Python 3.x out of the box, without
needing 2to3 conversion.

The top-level module no longer exports the following functions:
 - country_name_for_number
 - description_for_number
 - description_for_valid_number
These functions now need to be imported via the phonenumbers.geocoder submodule.

The short number functions have been renamed:
 - is_possible_short_number_object becomes is_possible_short_number
 - is_possible_short_number becomes is_possible_short_number_for_object
 - is_valid_short_number_object becomes is_valid_short_number
 - is_valid_short_number becomes is_valid_short_number_for_object
 - expected_cost becomes expected_cost_for_region, and there's a new expected_cost
   function that takes a PhoneNumber object.

Merge up to upstream Subversion revision 622; upstream code changelog:
    - Adding support for numbers with multiple Italian leading zeros, by
      adding a field to the phone number proto to allow an arbitrary number of
      leading zeros, and supporting this when parsing, validating and
      formatting.
    - Adding more functionality to ShortNumberInfo -> such as
      GetExpectedCostForRegion.
    - Fix for parsing short numbers that start with the national prefix.
    - Updating FormatNumberForMobileDialing to work with short numbers.
    - Stop finding Israeli 4-digit "star" numbers in text when no star is in
      fact present.
    - Bug fix for finding phone numbers where the area code was also part of
      the country calling code.


=====================
 What's new in 5.8b1
=====================

Rename shortnumberutil.py to shortnumberinfo.py
Merge up to upstream Subversion revision 603; upstream code changelog:
   - Renamed ShortNumberUtil to ShortNumberInfo -> the former class is now
     deprecated and will be deleted in a later release. At the moment it just
     delegates to ShortNumberInfo.
   - New methods in the ShortNumberInfo API - isCarrierSpecific, singleton interface,
     isPossibleShortNumber, isValidShortNumber, getShortNumberCost. Note this
     is an experimental API at the moment and subject to change.
   - Bug fixes:
      -- AsYouTypeFormatting: 3-digit numbers can be formatted as a group
         where appropriate
      -- AsYouTypeFormatting: Countries with an optional national prefix were
         considered before to have always entered it, resulting in bugs where
         numbers without the national prefix were not properly formatted.
      -- Numbers in Chile that overlap with emergency numbers are no longer
         marked as connecting to them
      -- Not requiring the NDC to be alone for countries where there is no
         national prefix in strict grouping when extracting phone numbers
