please sign up to the libphonenumber mailing list at

NOTE: A lot of methods in this module require Region Code strings. These must
be provided using CLDR two-letter region-code format. These should be in
upper-case. The list of the codes can be found here:

    This provides a more lenient check than is_valid_number in the following sense:

     - It only checks the length of phone numbers. In particular, it doesn't
       check starting digits of the number.

     - For some numbers (particularly fixed-line), many regions have the
       concept of area code, which together with subscriber number constitute
       the national significant number. It is sometimes okay to dial only the
